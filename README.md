# README: Puzzle Redesign Project

## Overview
This personal project focuses on using Autodesk Fusion 360 to redesign a puzzle. The goal is to explore the transition from a conceptual design to a manufacturable product through CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) processes. By understanding the intricacies of design and manufacturing, I aim to enhance my skills in both areas.

## Objectives
- **Redesign a Puzzle:** Create a new version of a traditional puzzle with improved features or aesthetics.
- **Utilize CAD and CAM:** Employ Fusion 360 to develop the puzzle design and generate necessary manufacturing instructions.
- **Understand Manufacturing Processes:** Investigate how the design can be translated into a practical manufacturing process, including material selection, machining techniques, and assembly methods.

## Tools Used
- **Autodesk Fusion 360:** For 3D modeling, simulation, and generating CAM toolpaths.
- **3D Printer / CNC Machine:** To manufacture the redesigned puzzle once the design is finalized.

## Project Phases
1. **Research and Conceptualization:**
   - Explore existing puzzle designs and identify areas for improvement.
   - Sketch initial ideas and select the best concept for further development.

2. **CAD Modeling:**
   - Use Fusion 360 to create a detailed 3D model of the redesigned puzzle.
   - Incorporate features that enhance functionality or user experience.

3. **CAM Preparation:**
   - Generate toolpaths in Fusion 360 for manufacturing the puzzle using CNC machining or 3D printing.
   - Select appropriate materials based on design requirements and manufacturing capabilities.

4. **Manufacturing and Assembly:**
   - Fabricate the redesigned puzzle using the chosen manufacturing method.
   - Assemble and test the final product to ensure functionality and performance.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully redesigned puzzle that demonstrates the principles of CAD and CAM.
- Enhanced understanding of the design-to-manufacturing process.
- Practical experience in using Fusion 360 for engineering design.

## Conclusion
This project represents an exciting opportunity to bridge the gap between design and manufacturing. By leveraging CAD and CAM tools, I aim to create a puzzle that not only serves as a functional product but also showcases my design and engineering skills.
